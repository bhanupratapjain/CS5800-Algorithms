/**
 * Created by Bhanu on 26/04/2016.

 Send as much flow from s as possible.
 Build a list of all vertices except s and t.
 As long as we have not traversed the entire list:
        Discharge the current vertex.
        If the height of the current vertex changed:
                Move the current vertex to the front of the list
                Restart the traversal from the front of the list.
